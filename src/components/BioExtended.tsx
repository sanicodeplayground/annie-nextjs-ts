          Hello! My name is Annie, and I am an illustrator currently based in
          Bristol.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          You can usually find me scribbling away outdoors in frequented spots.
          I also love getting involved with our local flora and fauna directly,
          through both my work as an ornithologist and my time spent ringing
          birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I normally use mixed media - paints, pens, pastels, collage and design
          software to create textural illustrations and murals in a unique
          style. I take time to understand the requirements of a brief, and I
          work with a balance of care and speed to project completion. I pride
          myself in my professional process - confidently getting things done,
          and turning my clientâ€™s ideas into reality.
        </p>

          Following the receipt of my BA degree in Illustration from The
          University of West England, I have been working on getting the
          narratives of both prevailing and endangered species into the world. I
          do so through my art, creating stories and worlds through my
          illustrations which I hope will inspire my readers to learn more about
          the world around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is a showcase of my work, both previous and current,
          including my illustrations and children&apos;s book designs. My focus
          is largely around natural history illustration, from both writing and
          designing fictional and non-fictional works. I love working with any
          analogue medium but I&apos; m particularly drawn to watercolour,
          graphite and ink work.
